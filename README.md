# AnalystGPT

AnalystGPT will search the news to create weekly summaries of the stock I hold in my portfolio. It will extract any key dates I should be aware of and why they are important. It will also attach sentiment analysis to the news stories so I can understand the general feel about a stock.

The app uses a simple sqlite database for storage.
