Despite the strong financial results, the stock price declined from approximately $195 to $180, reducing the company's market capitalization by about $365 billion. CEO Jensen Huang expressed frustration over this market reaction, suggesting that Nvidia's success may have fueled concerns about a potential AI investment bubble.

This potential concession could open up a significant market for Nvidia, with analysts projecting potential revenues of $15–25 billion from renewed access. However, uncertainties remain regarding Chinese demand and regulatory approvals.
