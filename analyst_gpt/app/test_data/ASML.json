{"title":"ASML Faces Investor Lawsuit Following Earnings Report","body":"In the past week, ASML Holding N.V. has become the subject of a securities class action lawsuit. The lawsuit alleges that the company made misleading statements regarding its financial outlook, particularly concerning its 2025 sales projections. This legal action follows ASML's October 15, 2024, earnings report, which revealed a significant decline in quarterly bookings and a downward revision of its 2025 net sales forecast. The report led to a sharp drop in ASML's stock price, falling over 16% on the day of the announcement.
